## ❓ Why?

Imagine, you are playing a game on your PC or doing something else. Your phone is on the other side of the room.

Or your phone runs out of battery.

This project also allows to see messages, without appearing as **Online** for your contacts or display the blue ticks that you have seen it.

Deleted messages are preserved too.

## Before you start...

**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE**

- Only use this on a private Discord Server! If other people are on that server, they might be able to read your private WhatsApp messages!
- Don't forget to set your Bot on `Private` after the setup is done!

Yes, you need a server/computer that runs 24/7 to use this.

Yes, your messages are safe using this.

This project implements a unofficial WhatsApp API, which runs on your own PC.

## 📖 Complete Documentation

For detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting, see the **[Complete Guide](GUIDE.md)**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Discord bot token, guild ID, and category ID
   ```

**Important Setup Notes:**
- For copying IDs you need to turn on the `Developer Mode` in the Discord Settings.
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` should be a **Discord category ID** where all WhatsApp chat channels will be created
- Create a category in your Discord server first, then copy its ID
- This keeps all WhatsApp chats organized in one place

**.env variables**

- Do not change the values on `VERSION`, `AUTHOR`, `GITHUB_REPO`.
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The Token to use your Bot.
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`: The ID for your Server.
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of the category, where your Chats should appear. *You may need to create a Category on your server for it.*.
- `ADMIN_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of a Textchannel, where you can execute admin command like `stats`, `getchats`, `purge`,....
- `ADMIN_WHATSAPP_CHAT_ID`: The WhatsApp ChatID that should be allowed to execute commands. *Can be your own number (where the bot runs) or another. Example-Format: `4912345678@c.us`*.

3. **Start the bridge:**
   ```bash
   bash start.sh
   ```

This project uses **pm2** which allows projects to run in the background. So **CRTL+C** does not stop the bot.

- `pm2 logs`: To see the output.
- `pm2 kill`: To kill the bot entirely.
- `pm2 restart all`: To restart the bot.
- `pm2 stop all`: To stop the bot for the moment.
- `pm2 start all`: To start after stopped.
